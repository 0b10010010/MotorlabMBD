DO NOT COPY THE SIMULINK FILE AND BUILD WITH DIFFERENT IOC FILE.
IT WILL GIVE YOU THE stm32_make_rtw_hook(): error with copyModelFiles() ERROR

For using the external mode with STM32-MAT Target, do not deploy the Simulink model. Instead, build the model, open the IDE, then run the debugger. And then connect to the Simulink model using the external mode control panel within Simulink.
